Abstract data types (mixins?) that models can implement, component can respond
to queries about what datatypes its models  can provide: mapping component can
ask component manager for all model addresses ('ComponentName::modelname') that
can provide addresses, and can ask the user which source to use (if they use the
mapping component directly, or specific components that use the mapping
component can specify which source they want to use)


Messages component:
-Triggers for data updates
 Pushes, like a new marker for the map
  New call... push to dispatcher, who pushes it an officer officer
   (computer offers distance info, and unobtrusively defaults to closest
    unocupied officer)
 RSS/XML/JSON feeds of updated information:
 <event>
	<text>Suspect #535 for case #495 pulled over for speeding</text>
        <date>timestamp</date>
	<id>13</id> # used for 'more info' link
	<lat>80</lat>
	<long>-130</long>
 </event>
