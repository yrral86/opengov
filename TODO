better testing
script/generate
better configuration handling(DRY)

Background:
Components have 0-N each of models, and views
and 0 - 1 controller


controller class
Option 1
-subclass ActionController::Base
-see if rails can support attaching and detatching controller objects at runtime

Option 2
-use sinatra for controller (CRUD)

-Create:
  POST /modelname/id
  form params

-Read:
  GET /viewname?id=value returns the view as html/json/xml
-Update:
  PUT /modelname/id
  form params

-Delete
  DELETE /modelname/id

-Then we have a simple http receiver that routes requests to the right component
-
-Component forks a thread to handle the request, returns
-Coponent responds to client directly




view list: erb most likely for html... json will also probably be useful


dependencies:

# here's a list of what we need... return what you don't have
need = ComponentManagerObject.need(["PersonLocator","AddressConverter"])
if need eq nil then
   ComponentManagerObject.register_component("PersonMapper",[],['person_marker.json','people_markers.json'])
else
  p "Dependecies not met: ' + need.join ","
end


PersonMapper returns json for client side javascript that does the mapping
