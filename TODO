better testing
script/generate
better configuration handling(DRY)

Installer
- Check dependencies
- Install software
- Configure web server
- Configure db (migrations)

Startup script

Login/Authentication
- db - authlogic: working
- system - authlogic_pam: working
- ldap- pam_ldap: should work once we configure pam
- nis- pam_nis: should work once we configure pam

handle views with no model in component class

Abstract data types that models can implement, component can respond
to queries about what datatypes its models  can provide: mapping component can
ask component manager for all model addresses ('ComponentName::modelname') that
can provide addresses, and can ask the user which source to use (if they use the
mapping component directly, or specific components that use the mapping
component can specify which source they want to use)


Messages component (maybe two different components: Triggers, Messages):
-Triggers for data updates
 Pushes, such as new marker for the map
  New call... push call location to dispatcher, who pushes it to an officer
   (computer offers distance info for each officer, and unobtrusively defaults
    to closest unoccupied officer)
- RSS/XML/JSON feeds of updated information
 <event>
	<text>Suspect #535 for case #495 pulled over for speeding</text>
        <date>timestamp</date>
	<id>13</id> # used for 'more info' link
	<lat>80</lat>
	<long>-130</long>
 </event>
