# install rvm, ruby, gems, and build passenger module
bash < <( curl -L http://bit.ly/rvm-install-system-wide )
# add development user to rvm group
# add this next line to end of /etc/profile
[[ -s "/usr/local/lib/rvm" ]] && . "/usr/local/lib/rvm"  # This loads RVM into a shell session

Don't use root... it screws with rvm, just make sure you are in rvm group:
rvm install 1.9.2
gem install `cat requirements/rubypackages`
passenger-install-apache2-module
create symlink: /usr/local/rvm/gems/default -> ruby-1.9.2-p0
(this should be added to rvm soon and kept up to date with the selected ruby)

# create databases (opengov_[development|test|production])

# install software/configuration
make deploy

# run db migrations (deploy does production)
ENV=test rake db:migrate
ENV=development rake db:migrate
