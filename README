Models require 3 templates in components/model/v/
model.rhtml # shows detailed view for one model record
modellist.rhtml # shows summary view for all model records
modelform.rhtml # form for editing model records*
* need to define hidden input _method='put'|'post'
  when html5 is better supported, forms can directly use put as method
  but we will still need that selectable in the template

URIs:
use GET to get forms, POST/PUT to submit them

CREATE
GET /component/model/edit : blank edit form
sends form to
POST /component/model : creates record
redirects to GET /component/model/id

READ
GET /component/model : list of records
GET /component/model/id : view of record
edit button goes to

UPDATE
GET /component/model/edit/id : edit form with record with id
sends form to 
PUT /component/model/id : saves record
redirects to GET /component/model/id

DELETE
DELETE /component/model/id : deletes record
redirects to GET /component/model
