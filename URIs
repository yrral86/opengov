Model:

We can write a few small js functions to do call the proper methods at the
proper times instead of url/parameter parsing to determine our routing

CREATE
POST /component/model : edit form
sends form to
POST /component/model : creates record
redirects to GET /component/model/id

READ
GET /component/model : list of records
GET /component/model/id : view of record
edit button goes to

UPDATE
PUT /component/model/id : edit form
sends form to 
PUT /component/model/id : saves record
redirects to GET /component/model/id

DELETE
DELETE /component/model/id : deletes record
redirects to GET /component/model
